MOD: jacko
==========

This mod is in development and is experimental. The following is written as close as possible from the prospective of the latest release version being complete. This helps with editing the documentation less, and shows the design goals. Version 0 was the first commit of the Forge example code and further releases are on the releases page.

The design aim is to change the game by adding in a future. A time where many things are easier, and some things are new. All to see the new world that can become. Contrary to the assumption this makes the game easy, it just changes the game to a new level where new things are difficult.
