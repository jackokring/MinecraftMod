Sigma Block
-----------

A multiply and accumulate using sides A and B multiplied (and optionally scaled by division by 16) and the IN added.
The result is the output modulo 16. No consideration for carries between Sigma blocks is allowed in this design.
The scaling is to simulate very low precision fixed point functionality. A modulo 16 additive inverse may be
subtracted hence keeping the carries out of it as external redstone signals. This also might prepare the user for
some technology production in the real world where carries lead to bottlenecks in OoO execution of machine instructions.
It also has some useful logic limit (0 or 15) forms which can be dropped by the additive inverse method.
